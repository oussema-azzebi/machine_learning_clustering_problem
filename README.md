# machine_learning_clustering_problem
Solve a clustering problem in python

1. Description of the problem:
The context is that of employment. The objective is to determine the job of a candidate from information on his skills.

2. Tasks to be carried out:
   • Unsupervised clustering to identify 2 groups of distinct technical profiles
   • A prediction of profiles whose profession is not labeled
   • An action plan to respond to a complex problem.

3. Description of the files

   • Clustering_ML.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook which contains the questions as well as the answers to this problem!

   • Data.csv: This file contains a dataset of ~ 10,000 lines describing the profile of the candidates.
               This table is made up of 6 columns:

      - Company: corresponds to a list of fictitious companies
      - Job: corresponds to the candidate's job (This list contains the values: "data scientist", "lead data scientist", "data engineer"                and "data architect"
      - Technologies: corresponds to the skills mastered by the profile
      - Diploma: corresponds to his academic level (Bac, Master, PhD ...)
      - Experience: corresponds to the number of years of experience
      - City: corresponds to the workplace

   • Two standard CVs given as examples to answer the last question (in the jupyter notebook file)
